                        <li>Not only about monetary value, but e.g. documents of ownership.</li>
                        <li>Have to avoid double spending of the same value/money/assets. Some ways for that:</li>

                                <li><i>Ledgers</i>: Record book, keep track of value without physical. Need to keep track - not so security</li>

                        <li>In the bank crisis, banks started to lend money to households who will have difficult time paying it back.</li>
                        <li>Banks started to create very sophisticated financial products, that repackaged those risky debts and asked partners to rate those <b>CDOs</b> (collateral debt obligations) with very safe <b>triple A ratings</b></li>

                 <h3>The 3-layer Model</h3>
                 <div class="content-details">    
                     <p><u>The technology behind Bitcoin:</u> the receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing. This prevents the sender from preparing a <b>chain of blocks</b> ahead of time by working on it continously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at the moment.</p> 
                     <p>The 3-layer model</p> 
                     <ul>

                <h3>Blockchain Design Goals</h3>
                <div class="content-details">  
                    <p>Peer-to-peer data distribution</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data itself and processes to read and modified the data</li>
                        <li>In centralized setup, if the data storage is lost, it's gone forever. Here comes the distribution.</li>
                        <li>Distribute several copies of it in a way that if one node fails, you can still retreive the data.</li>
                        <li>Only one node can modify the data, all others can keep a copy and synchronize it in read-only node.</li>
                        <li>Everyone can potentially see and verify the entire dataset. Creates issues with privacy though. This is solved with pseudonimity.</li>
                        <li>Scalability issue: volume of data. All modificiations are stored.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p>Decentralization</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If there is only one centralized point of modifications, it still is a weakness - if this point fails, the whole system stops working</li>
                        <li>If each node has power of modifying and applying changes, then its almost impossible to take it down. </li>
                        <li>Issue with consistency - if all the nodes can modify the data in the way they want it, how do you ensure that they all work in the same way?</li>
                        <li>In blockchain it is solved by <b>consensus algorithm</b>: change the owner of the changes randomly all the time</li>
                    </ul>  
                    <p>Immutability</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Changing historical data is a risk.</li>
                        <li>Only thing you can do is append transactions</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p>Trustless Environment</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nodes can join the network at any time and start making changes without needing to trust them. </li>
                        <li>Trust should be build in the system.</li>

                    <p>In <u>Bitcoin</u> peer-to-peer distribution, decentralization and immutability is created in completely trustless environment</p>   
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basic element that transactions are keeping track of: Unspend Transaction Output (UTXO) - digital equivalent of a check.</li>
                        <li>Bitcoin takes non-cashed checks as inputs, makes a transaction and produces non-cashed checks as outputs.</li>
                        <li>Any node in the network can create and sign these transactions</li>
                        <li>Every 10 minutes, there is a competition, which node will append which transactions. This happens automatically.</li>
                        <li>To make the process more efficient, transactions are grouped in blocks of transations</li>
                        <li>The nodes are motivated to participate because the winner of the transaction includes one transaction to send it to himself.
                            <ul>
                                <li>This is the only way how the currency actually gets created</li>
                                <li>It incentivizes miners to do the best work.</li>

                    <p>Implementation Artifacts</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There can be several coding languages, but they should all have the same protocols and algorithms. So that a code created by any version, is accepted by any other version</li>
                        <li>This code is usually open-source.</li>
                        <li>Easy to create new blockchain</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Ethereum Implementation</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More opportunities than just a currency system</li>
                        <li>If you made the variables even more generic, you can turn it into generic, decentralized, distributed computer: whether on top of blockchain (sidechain) or a part of complete new implementation - that's Ethereum </li>
                        <li>All the same principles as Bitcoin, adds a few more and does it slightly differently.</li>
                        <li>In Ethereum there are no UTXOs because it stores the balance after each block</li>
                        <li>In Ethereum the block schedule is 17s</li>
                        <li>In Ethereum transactions can have some code attached to them - this allows to execute more sophisticated pieces of logic: <b>smart contracts</b></li>
                        <li>To make sure that these smart contracts do not overload the system, you have to pay a small fee, called "Ether". </li>
                        <li>Ethereum is working on changing the "proof of consensus" algorithm to "<b>proof of stake</b>" algorithm</li>
                    </ul>
