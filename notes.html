                    <p>Network of Information</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Internet is Network of Information where data is transmitted from node to node through <u>copy</u>.</li>
                        <li>Once data is injected into the internet, it replicates and spreads rapidly and will never be unique again.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Network of Value</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Value should be transferred as a <u>move</u>, not as a copy.</li>
                        <li>Not only about monetary value, but e.g. documents of ownership.</li>
                        <li>Have to avoid double spending of the same value/money/assets. Some ways for that:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><i>Notes</i>: Physical Value, anonymous and trustable. Creating it costs money. Losing it means it is gone forever </li>
                                <li><i>Ledgers</i>: Record book, keep track of value without physical. Need to keep track - not so security</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Compensation Process</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Digital ledgers: Digital system of value storage and transfer (for banks)</li>
                        <li>Each bank keeps its own ledger.</li>
                        <li>Need to synchronize all these seperate ledgers.</li>
                        <li>Banking system is a set of centralized databases of transactions</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Bank lends money and adds transaction to it's own ledger</li>
                        <li>The money lent did not really exist before. It was created via <b>debt</b></li>
                        <li>Banks are legally allowed to land more money than they have if they protect their risk</li>
                        <li>That's why there are interests proportional to the risk</li>
                        <li>In the bank crisis, banks started to lend money to households who will have difficult time paying it back.</li>
                        <li>Banks started to create very sophisticated financial products, that repackaged those risky debts and asked partners to rate those <b>CDOs</b> (collateral debt obligations) with very safe <b>triple A ratings</b></li>
                        <li>When lenders couldn't pay the mortgages back, everything collapsed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Birth of Bitcoin</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2008 November - same time of financial crisis</li>
                        <li>New kind of monetary system - create and store value in completely digital form. Fully decentralized.</li>

                        <li>Selling a car / wiring the value in currency, receiving physical asset - car</li>
                        <li>Selling a house: wiring the value in currency, receiving ownership of the house (via ledger that keeps the transaction details)</li>
                        <li>Selling electricity: produce electricity (physicial records), keep a ledger with all the details, where it goes and who uses it</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A currency transaction</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Origin / Destination / Value / State</li>
                        <li>Simple logic: if the balance is greater than the amount, decrease it and add it to the others persons account </li>
                        <li>With Bitcoin (currency), same program applies for all transactions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A generic transaction</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More variables, more tests, more loops.</li>

                    <p>Smart Contracts</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programs that are stored on the blockchain itself and functions of those programs are executed in transactions</li>
                        <li>The transactions can have different sizes etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Smart Contract Use Cases</p>
