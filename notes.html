                        <li>In the bank crisis, banks started to lend money to households who will have difficult time paying it back.</li>
                        <li>Banks started to create very sophisticated financial products, that repackaged those risky debts and asked partners to rate those <b>CDOs</b> (collateral debt obligations) with very safe <b>triple A ratings</b></li>

                 <h3>The 3-layer Model</h3>
                 <div class="content-details">    
                     <p><u>The technology behind Bitcoin:</u> the receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing. This prevents the sender from preparing a <b>chain of blocks</b> ahead of time by working on it continously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at the moment.</p> 
                     <p>The 3-layer model</p>

                <h3>Blockchain Design Goals</h3>
                <div class="content-details">  
                    <p>Peer-to-peer data distribution</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data itself and processes to read and modified the data</li>
                        <li>In centralized setup, if the data storage is lost, it's gone forever. Here comes the distribution.</li>
                        <li>Distribute several copies of it in a way that if one node fails, you can still retreive the data.</li>
                        <li>Only one node can modify the data, all others can keep a copy and synchronize it in read-only node.</li>
                        <li>Everyone can potentially see and verify the entire dataset. Creates issues with privacy though. This is solved with pseudonimity.</li>
                        <li>Scalability issue: volume of data. All modificiations are stored.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p>Decentralization</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If there is only one centralized point of modifications, it still is a weakness - if this point fails, the whole system stops working</li>
                        <li>If each node has power of modifying and applying changes, then its almost impossible to take it down. </li>
                        <li>Issue with consistency - if all the nodes can modify the data in the way they want it, how do you ensure that they all work in the same way?</li>
                        <li>In blockchain it is solved by <b>consensus algorithm</b>: change the owner of the changes randomly all the time</li>
                    </ul>  
                    <p>Immutability</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Changing historical data is a risk.</li>
                        <li>Only thing you can do is append transactions</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p>Trustless Environment</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nodes can join the network at any time and start making changes without needing to trust them. </li>
                        <li>Trust should be build in the system.</li>

                    <p>In <u>Bitcoin</u> peer-to-peer distribution, decentralization and immutability is created in completely trustless environment</p>   
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basic element that transactions are keeping track of: Unspend Transaction Output (UTXO) - digital equivalent of a check.</li>
                        <li>Bitcoin takes non-cashed checks as inputs, makes a transaction and produces non-cashed checks as outputs.</li>
                        <li>Any node in the network can create and sign these transactions</li>
                        <li>Every 10 minutes, there is a competition, which node will append which transactions. This happens automatically.</li>
                        <li>To make the process more efficient, transactions are grouped in blocks of transations</li>
                        <li>The nodes are motivated to participate because the winner of the transaction includes one transaction to send it to himself.
                            <ul>
                                <li>This is the only way how the currency actually gets created</li>
                                <li>It incentivizes miners to do the best work.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>There can be several coding languages, but they should all have the same protocols and algorithms. So that a code created by any version, is accepted by any other version</li>
                        <li>This code is usually open-source.</li>
                        <li>Easy to create new blockchain</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Ethereum Implementation</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More opportunities than just a currency system</li>
                        <li>If you made the variables even more generic, you can turn it into generic, decentralized, distributed computer: whether on top of blockchain (sidechain) or a part of complete new implementation - that's Ethereum </li>
                        <li>All the same principles as Bitcoin, adds a few more and does it slightly differently.</li>
                        <li>In Ethereum there are no UTXOs because it stores the balance after each block</li>
                        <li>In Ethereum the block schedule is 17s</li>
                        <li>In Ethereum transactions can have some code attached to them - this allows to execute more sophisticated pieces of logic: <b>smart contracts</b></li>
                        <li>To make sure that these smart contracts do not overload the system, you have to pay a small fee, called "Ether". </li>
                        <li>Ethereum is working on changing the "proof of consensus" algorithm to "<b>proof of stake</b>" algorithm</li>
                    </ul>

                         <li><u>Discontinuous:</u> the slightest difference in the input, will give completely different output</li>
                         <li><u>Uniform:</u> for any set of inputs, corresponding outputs should be distributed as evenly as possible accross the possible range of outputs. </li>

                        <li>The only way to recover the original content is to reverse the process using the associated public key for the decryption process</li>
                        <li>The keys are related (from the private one, the public one is generated). But you cannot recover the private key from the public one</li>

                        <li>You start by hasing this message by using a hashing function to get a defined length hash</li>

                        <li>You send the original message together with the encrypted hash (called signature)</li>

                <p>Naive block hashes</p>          
                <ul>
                    <li>Hash the entire block (transactions) at once</li>
                    <li>But this block can be big and you will need to wait for all transactions to be there before calculating the hash (on miners side)</li>
                    <li>You would need to download the whole block to verify its integrity (on users side)</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>Merkle Tree</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Calculate hash (h1- h8) for each transaction (t1-t8)</li>
                    <li>Calculate a hash of (h1+h2) and you get a new hash (h12)</li>
                    <li>Do the same for each pair and repeat the process</li>
                    <li>When all the concatenations are done, you get a root hash</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Modification impact</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If only one transaction changes, the root hash is completely different</li>
                    <li>Two identical root hashes correspond to identical blocks</li>
                    <li>You can calculate the hash progressivly as your receive the transactions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Partial Verification</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To verify the integrity of t5 you would need to get h5 and h6 to get h56 and some other things to calculate the root hash</li>
                </ul>

                        <li>First you need to install XCode (on app store) and start the application to accept the T&Cs. Then quit the Xcode.<</li> 
                        <li>In the terminal "xcode-select --install"</li>
                        <li>Install HomeBrew:

                     <p>Intall Geth (aka go-ethereum)</p>   
                     <ul>
                         <li>Command Line interface that allows to run and operate full ethereum node.</li>
                         <li>Geth is implemented in Go adn allows you to mine blocks, to generate Ether, to deploy and interact with smart contracts, to transfer funds, to inspect block history, to create accounts and do all the things that are needed for managing Ethereum node</li>
                         <li>Geth can be used to connect to the public Ethereum Network (main net) or to create your own private network for development purposes</li>
                         <li>Let's you fully test your application before deploying it to the live network.</li>
                         <li>Install using Homebrew:
                             <ul>
                                 <li>Connect Homebrew to the repository providing Geth: 1."brew update", 2."brew tap ethereum/ethereum", 3."brew install ethereum" </li>
                                 <li>"brew upgrade ethereum" if you need to update the version</li>
                             </ul>
                         </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Install Ganache</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Ethereum blockchain emulator that you can use for development purposes</li>
                         <li>Can be seen as a replacement for "Test RPC", which were used in previous versions of the course</li>
                         <li>UI that allows to inspect blocks and transactions in a user friendly way</li>
                         <li>Compared to Geth, Ganache is an "in-memory" Ethereum node, that runs faster and provides all the visual components for testing your contracts locally before deploying them to real Ethereum application</li>
                         <li>http://truffleframework.com/ganache - download the app from here</li>

                         <li>When we install Node, we also install the Node Package Manager: NPM, that is required to set up and install most of the tools to develop Ethereum.</li>
                         <li>Check if you already have it installed: "node -v" and "npm -v"</li>
